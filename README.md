## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Ishai, i have recently finished my programing training at InfinityLabs R&D.  
I'm now leveraging the GitHub platform to develop and maintain new projects, exploring concepts and technologies that are new to me and that I find intriguing.  

 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my full-stack Web Bank App project and expending it functionalities.  

 ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about the MERN Stack, focusing on:
 - Designing a robust backend with the Express.js framework
 - Planning efficient MongoDB schemas for optimized queries
